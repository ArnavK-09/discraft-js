## How to contribute
Not much to say here. Fork the repo, clone it, and make a PR.
I recommend installing [bun](https://bun.sh) on your system, as you will need it for build scripts and general development. I do development in Zed, but VS Code will probably do fine too. If you don't install bun, you will want typescript and `ts-node` or similar.

The project templates are in `templates/` and the library CLI (for the `discraft` command) is in `cli/`. If you want to export stuff from the library (like you would with a typical npm library), please ask first.
Feel free to create new templates, but maintainers may heavily modify them or reject them.

You may also create an issue with feedback, feature requests, bug reports, or code that isn't worth creating a PR over.

Thanks to all you awesome contributors!
